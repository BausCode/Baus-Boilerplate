Utilities
===================

The purpose of this folder is to house all the utility files.  A utility is a class that has a single purpose and will not fit in a default or module.  Because utilities are so focused, they will generally use `!important` to ensure their styles are always applied.

Utilities should not be edited while in use, unless it is to fix a bug. Modifications to utilities cascade throughout the application and should be made with extreme care.
